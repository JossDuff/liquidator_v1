# liquidator_v1

# Roadmap

## Phase 1: Start
- extremely basic liquidator
- API call and flash swap

## Phase 2: Scale
- store positions in a database
- batching RPC calls (multicall)
- Confirm the fastest way to get chain data: API, theGraph, or custom indexer

## Phase 2: Spread
- script to deploy onto any lending protocol and fork
- target small lending protocols with not much competition

## Phase 3: Slaughter
- suit up to be competive on large lending protocols
- my own ethereum/OP/ARB/etc nodes
- private flashbot mempool submitting transactions directly to miners
